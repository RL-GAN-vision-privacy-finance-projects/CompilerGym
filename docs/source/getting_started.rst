CompilerGym is a toolkit for applying reinforcement learning to compiler
optimization tasks. This document provides a short walkthrough of the key
concepts, using the codesize reduction task of a production-grade compiler
as an example. It will take about 20 minutes to work through. Lets get
started!

Key Concepts
--------------------

CompilerGym exposes compiler optimization problems as environments for
reinforcement learning. It uses the `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_
interface to expose the "agent-environment loop" of reinforcement learning:

.. image:: /_static/img/overview.png

The ingredients for reinforcement learning that CompilerGym provides are:

* **Environment**: a compiler optimization task. For example,
  *optimizing a C++ graph-traversal program for codesize using LLVM*. The
  environment encapsulates an instance of a compiler and a particular program
  that is being compiled. As an agent interacts with the environment, the state
  of the program, and the compiler, can change.

* **Action Space**: the actions that may be taken at the current environment
  state. For example, this could be a set of optimization transformations that
  the compiler can apply to the program.

* **Observation**: a view of the current environment state. For example, this
  could be the Intermediate Representation (IR) of the program that is being
  compiled. The types of observations that are available depend on the compiler.

* **Reward**: a metric indicating the quality of the previous action. For
  example, for a codesize optimization task this could be the change to the
  number of instructions of the previous action.

A single instance of this "agent-environment loop" represents the compilation of
a particular program. The goal is to develop an agent that maximises the
cumulative reward from these environments so as to produce the best programs.

Using CompilerGym
-----------------

Begin by firing up a python interpreter:

.. code-block::

    $ python

To start with we import the gym module and the CompilerGym environments:

    >>> import gym
    >>> import compiler_gym

Importing :mod:`compiler_gym` automatically registers the compiler environments.

We can see what environments are available using:

    >>> compiler_gym.COMPILER_GYM_ENVS
    ['llvm-v0', 'llvm-ic-v0', 'llvm-autophase-ic-v0', 'llvm-ir-ic-v0']


Selecting an environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CompilerGym environments are named using one of the following formats:

#. :code:`<compiler>-<observation>-<reward>-<version>`
#. :code:`<compiler>-<reward>-<version>`
#. :code:`<compiler>-<version>`

Where :code:`<compiler>` identifiers the compiler optimization task,
:code:`<observation>` is the default type of observations that are provided,
and :code:`<reward>` is the reward signal.

.. note::
    A key concept is that
    CompilerGym environments enables **lazy evaluation** of observations and
    reward signals. This makes the environment much more computationally
    efficient for scenarios in which you do not need to compute a reward or
    observation for every step. If an environment omits a :code:`<observation>`
    or :code:`<reward>` tag, this means that no observation or reward is
    provided by default. See :doc:`compiler_gym.views <compiler_gym/views>` for
    further details.

For this tutorial, we will use the following environment:

* **Compiler**: :doc:`LLVM <llvm/index>`.
* **Observation Type**: :ref:`Autophase <llvm/index:Autophase>`.
* **Reward Signal**: :ref:`IR Instruction count relative to -Oz <llvm/index:Codesize>`.

Create an instance of this environment using:

    >>> env = gym.make("llvm-autophase-ic-v0")


Installing benchmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A compiler requires a program as input. For the purposes of CompilerGym we call
these input programs *benchmarks*, and collections of benchmarks are assembled
into *datasets*. You may provide your own programs to use as benchmarks, or
download one of our pre-assembled datasets.

The benchmarks that are available to an environment can be queried using
:attr:`env.benchmarks <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.benchmarks>`:

    >>> env.benchmarks
    []

As you can see, there are no benchmarks installed by default. We have provided
a collection of pre-assembled
:ref:`LLVM benchmark datasets <llvm/index:Datasets>` that can be
installed using
:meth:`env.require_dataset() <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.require_dataset>`.
For this tutorial we will use the
`NAS Parallel Benchmarks <https://www.nas.nasa.gov/publications/npb.html>`_
dataset:

    >>> env.require_dataset("npb-v0")

Now, :attr:`env.benchmarks <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.benchmarks>` lists
the 123 benchmarks that comprise the dataset we just installed:

    >>> env.benchmarks
    ['benchmark://npb-v0/46', 'benchmark://npb-v0/17', ...]

The compiler environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have experience using `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_, the
CompilerGym environments will be familiar. If not, you can call :code:`help()`
on any function, object, or method to query the documentation:

    >>> help(env)

The action space is described by
:meth:`env.action_space <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.action_space>`.
The :ref:`LLVM Action Space <llvm/index:Action Space>` is discrete:

    >>> env.action_space.dtype
    dtype('int64')
    >>> env.action_space.n
    138

The observation space is described by
:meth:`env.observation_space <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.observation_space>`.
The :ref:`Autophase <llvm/index:Autophase>` observation space is a 56-dimension
vector of integers:

    >>> env.observation_space.shape
    (56,)
    >>> env.observation_space.dtype
    dtype('int64')

The upper and lower bounds of the reward signal are described by
:meth:`env.reward_range <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.reward_range>`:

    >>> env.reward_range
    (0.0, inf)

As with other Gym environments,
:meth:`reset() <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.reset>`
must be called before a CompilerGym environment may be used:

    >>> env.reset()
    array([   0,    0,  399,  381,   10,  399,  147,    8,  137,  147,    0,
              0,    0,  556,    0,  546,    0,   15,  693,  574, 1214, 1180,
            384,  399,  214,    0,  120,  116,    0,   88,  468,    8,  546,
             16, 1073,  147,    0, 1551,    0,    0,    0,   10,  766,    0,
              0,  505,   46,    0,    0,    0,  556, 5075, 3261,   13,    0,
           2441])

The numpy array that is returned here is the initial
:ref:`Autophase <llvm/index:Autophase>` observation. Calling
:meth:`env.reset() <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.reset>` starts an
instance of the compiler and selects a random benchmark to use. You can see
which benchmark is currently being used by an environment using
:attr:`env.benchmark <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.benchmark>`:

    >>> env.benchmark
    'benchmark://npb-v0/90'

If we want to force the environment to use a specific benchmark, we can pass the
name of the benchmark as an argument to
:meth:`env.reset() <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.reset>`:

    >>> env.reset(benchmark="benchmark://npb-v0/50")
    array([   0,    0,   26,   25,    1,   26,   10,    1,    8,   10,    0,
              0,    0,   37,    0,   36,    0,    2,   46,  175, 1664, 1212,
            263,   26,  193,    0,   59,    6,    0,    3,   32,    0,   36,
             10, 1058,   10,    0,  840,    0,    0,    0,    1,  416,    0,
              0,  148,   60,    0,    0,    0,   37, 3008, 2062,    9,    0,
           1262])


Interacting with the environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once an environment has been initialized, you interact with it in the same way
that you would with any other `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_
environment. :meth:`env.render() <compiler_gym.envs.LlvmEnv.render>` prints
the Intermediate Representation (IR) of the program in the current state:

    >>> env.render()
    ; ModuleID = 'benchmark://npb-v0/83'
    target datalayout = "e-m:e-p270:32:32-p271:32:32-p272:64:64-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
    target triple = "x86_64-pc-linux-gnu"
    ...

:meth:`env.step() <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.step>` runs an action:

    >>> observation, reward, done, info = env.step(0)

This returns four values: a new observation, a reward, a boolean value
indicating whether the episode has ended, and a dictionary of additional
information:

    >>> observation
    array([   0,    0,   26,   25,    1,   26,   10,    1,    8,   10,    0,
              0,    0,   37,    0,   36,    0,    2,   46,  175, 1664, 1212,
            263,   26,  193,    0,   59,    6,    0,    3,   32,    0,   36,
             10, 1058,   10,    0,  840,    0,    0,    0,    1,  416,    0,
              0,  148,   60,    0,    0,    0,   37, 3008, 2062,    9,    0,
           1262])
    >>> reward
    0.3151595744680851
    >>> done
    False
    >>> info
    {'action_had_no_effect': True, 'new_action_space': False}

For this environment, reward represents the reduction in code size of the
previous action, scaled to the total codesize reduction achieved with LLVM's
:code:`-Oz` optimizations enabled. A cumulative reward greater than one means
that the sequence of optimizations performed yields better results than LLVM's
default optimizations. Let's run 100 random actions and see how close we can
get:

    >>> env.reset(benchmark="benchmark://npb-v0/50")
    >>> episode_reward = 0
    >>> for i in range(1, 101):
    ...     observation, reward, done, info = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
    ...     if done:
    ...         break
    ...     episode_reward += reward
    ...     print(f"Step {i}, quality={episode_reward:.3%}")
    ...
    Step 1, quality=44.299%
    Step 2, quality=44.299%
    Step 3, quality=44.299%
    Step 4, quality=44.299%
    Step 5, quality=44.299%
    Step 6, quality=54.671%
    Step 7, quality=54.671%
    Step 8, quality=54.608%
    Step 9, quality=54.608%
    Step 10, quality=54.608%
    Step 11, quality=54.608%
    Step 12, quality=54.766%
    Step 13, quality=54.766%
    Step 14, quality=53.650%
    Step 15, quality=53.650%
    ...
    Step 97, quality=88.104%
    Step 98, quality=88.104%
    Step 99, quality=88.104%
    Step 100, quality=88.104%

Not bad, but clearly there is room for improvement! Because at each step we are
taking random actions, your results will differ with every run. Try running it
again. Was the result better or worse? Of course, there may be better ways of
selecting actions than choosing randomly, but for the purpose of this tutorial
we will leave that as an exercise for the reader :)

Before we finish, lets use
:meth:`env.commandline() <compiler_gym.envs.CompilerEnv.commandline>`
to produce an LLVM :code:`opt` command line invocation that is equivalent to
the sequence of actions we just run:

    >>> env.commandline()
    'opt -consthoist -sancov -inferattrs ... -place-safepoints input.bc -o output.bc'

We can also save the program for future reference:

    >>> env.write_bitcode("~/program.bc")

Once we are finished, we must close the environment to end the compiler
instance:

    >>> env.close()

And finally we are done with our python session:

    >>> exit()

Using the command line tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CompilerGym includes a set of useful :doc:`command line tools <cli>`. Each of
the steps above could be replicated from the command line.

For example, :mod:`compiler_gym.bin.service` can be used to list the available
environments:

.. code-block::

    $ python -m compiler_gym.bin.service --ls_env
    llvm-v0
    ...

And to describe the capabilities of each environment:

.. code-block::

    $ python -m compiler_gym.bin.service --env=llvm-v0
    # CompilerGym Service `/path/to/compiler_gym/envs/llvm/service/compiler_gym-llvm-service`

    ## Programs

    +------------------------+
    | Benchmark              |
    +========================+
    | benchmark://npb-v0/1   |
    +------------------------+

    ...

    ## Action Spaces


    ### `PassesAll` (Commandline)

    +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
    | Action                                | Flag                              | Description                   |
    +=======================================+===================================+===============================+
    | AddDiscriminatorsPass                 | `-add-discriminators`             | Add DWARF path discriminators |
    +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
    ...

The :mod:`compiler_gym.bin.manual_env` module provides a thin text user
interface around the environment for interactive sessions:

.. code-block::

    $ python -m compiler_gym.bin.manual_env --env=llvm-autophase-ic-v0 --benchmark=npb-v0/50
    Initialized environment in 264.9ms
    Reset benchmark://npb-v0/50 environment in 27.6ms
    Observation: [  0   0  11  10   1  11   5   1   3   5   0   0   0  17   0  16   0   2
      21  20  50  44  18  11   6   0   3  10   0   1  16   0  16   2  40   5
       0  59   0   0   0   1  30   0   0  18   0   0   0   0  17 193 129   4
       0  99]

Finally, the :mod:`compiler_gym.bin.random_search` module provides a simple
but powerful strategy for randomly searching the optimization space:

.. code-block::

    $ python -m compiler_gym.bin.random_search --env=llvm-autophase-ic-v0 --benchmark=npb-v0/50 --runtime=10

    Started 16 worker threads for benchmark://npb-v0/50 (3,008 instructions) using reward IrInstructionCountOz.

    Step [069 / 069]: reward=107.85%, change=0.24%, action=Gvnpass

To beat the compiler by 7.85% after 10 seconds of random trials is not bad
going!
